        Kabir Café or Neeraj Arya's Kabir Café is an Indian indie-folk and
        folk-fusion music band based in Mumbai. Originated in 2013, it consists
        of Neeraj Arya, founder and Mukund Ramaswamy, co-founder of the band
        along with other artists. Neeraj Arya, the founder of the group and a
        self-taught artist started his music career as a solo-artist in early

        2000s. Influenced by his guru Prahlad Singh Tipaniya, Neeraj Arya was
        introduced to the 15th century's saint Kabir and started playing folk
        melodies of Kabir's dohas and Samji's. In 2012, performing on the
        streets of Mumbai as part of the non-profit organisation, Natural
        Streets for Performing Arts (NSPA), Arya met violinist Mukund Ramaswamy,
        who is a Carnatic Violinist, and the two started performing as a duo.
        The band members always refer to Saint Kabir as the first member because
        the songs are based on the teachings and philosophy of Kabir .
